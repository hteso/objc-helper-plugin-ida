zynamics Objective-C helper script


# Description

This is an idapython script that analyzes ARM/Objective-C files in
order to patch calls made to msgSend(), in order to have a better
callgraph and more useful cross references. A bit of extra information
can be found on:

Also fixObjectiveCx86 implements a port that works on x86 binaries, as
Vincenzo explains in this other blog post:

# Prerequisites

The script has been developed and tested using IDA 5.6 and idapython
1.3.0 but it should work with older versions.


# Usage

Just open the target executable file or IDB and run the script. If you
are working with iPhoneOS binaries you will find your target inside the
IPA file. And remember that applications downloaded from the AppStore
have the code section encrypted, so you will need to decrypt it before
running the script or trying to analyze it.

After running the script is recommended to make IDA re-analyze the
program to get the correct assembly listings and cross references. In
order to do that, inside IDA go to `Options->General->Analysis` and then
click on `Reanalyze Program`.

WARNING:
This script modifies the IDA DataBase by creating new segments and
patching code. If you don't know the implications of this, it is
a good idea to have a backup of the database.
